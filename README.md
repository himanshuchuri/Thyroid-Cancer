# Cancer Reccurance -Thyroid

Accoring to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that in 2024, there will be about 44,020 new cases of thyroid cancer and around 2,170 deaths.
The average diagnosis of 51. According to my previous visualization of cancer among the age groups of 20-40 yrs it was noted that thyroid was the most common type of cancer

Until recently, rate of new thyroid cancers was growing faster than for any other cancer in the US. This was largely due to increased detection during imaging tests such as CT or MRI scans that were done for other medical problems. These sensitive tests can sometimes detect small thyroid nodules that might not otherwise have been found (and many of which might never have caused any problems). However, due in part to adoption of more stringent criteria for diagnosing thyroid cancer, the incidence rate has declined by about 2% each year since 2014.
